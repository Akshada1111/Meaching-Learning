# Meaching-Learning
# Laptop Price Prediction 
# Overview
This project aims to predict laptop prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of laptops such as  RAM, storage, and brand, we develop a predictive model .
# Steps Involved
# Data Collection: Acquiring laptop specifications and price data.
# Data Preprocessing:
1)Handling missing values
2)Encoding categorical features
3)Feature scaling and transformation
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing data distributions
Identifying correlations between features
Model Training & Evaluation:
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
Training multiple ML models
Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE, RÂ² score
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Prediction & Deployment:
# How to Run the Project
# Run the Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluation:
jupyter notebook
# Results
The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics, and its predictions are compared with actual prices to ensure accuracy.
# Future Enhancements
Expanding the dataset for better generalization
Incorporating deep learning models for improved accuracy
Deploying a web-based interface for real-time price prediction
